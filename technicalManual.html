                <p>In order to get the charts, the employee must select first a range of dates, then when clicks on "Search" button a success message is displayed to let the employee know that there are registered calls between that range of dates. Besides showing the message, a section of general information is created. This section contains a summary of the charts, for example, the total number of calls, how many people called, diversity of topics, etc.</p>
                <p>The section of the charts presents the statitstics in a visual way, helping the employee understand the data more easily. The first chart shows in which days there were calls registered and how many. After the first one, three more charts are presented: the chart on the left represents the frequency of the topics or subject treated during the calls, similar to the chart on the middle, represents how many calls were registered during the morning or afternoon news program. Finally, the chart on the right shows the ratio between a positive or a negative comment evaluation.</p>
